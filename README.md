# VSCode Efficient Keybindings

## Overview

This repository contains a set of custom keybindings for Visual Studio Code (VSCode), designed to enhance efficiency and minimize the reliance on a mouse. The keybindings are inspired by Vim's keyboard-centric approach, providing a quick and seamless navigation experience within VSCode. The goal is to keep your hands on the keyboard as much as possible, reducing the need to switch between the keyboard and mouse, and thereby streamlining your coding workflow.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of these keybindings is to bring some of the speed and efficiency of Vim into VSCode without fully transitioning to Vim. It's an ideal setup for those who appreciate the power of keyboard shortcuts in their development environment and want to navigate and edit code more swiftly. By keeping the fingers in a natural position and reducing hand movements, these keybindings aim to enhance productivity and comfort.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Utilizes `i`, `j`, `k`, `l` for directional navigation (up, left, down, right), mimicking the arrow keys but in a more natural position for your hands.
- **Selection and Movement**: Includes combinations for selecting text and moving the cursor over larger distances (lines and words).
- **Tab Navigation**: Easy switching between editor tabs without reaching for the mouse.
- **Code Inspection**: Shortcuts for quick access to definitions and hover information.
- **Efficient Editing**: Specialized shortcuts for common coding tasks like inserting console logs.

## Installation

1. Open VSCode.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
3. Type `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` and select it.
4. Copy the contents of the `keybindings.json` from this repository into your VSCode `keybindings.json` file.
5. Save the file, and the new keybindings will be active immediately.

## Customization

Feel free to modify these keybindings to suit your personal preferences or workflow. This setup is meant to be a starting point, and customization is encouraged to achieve the most comfortable and efficient setup for your needs.

## Note

There may be shortcuts on your computer that you may need to override. This should be pretty apparent when you try to use these keybindings in VSCode, they will be overridden by system-level shortcuts.
